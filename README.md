# React Product Dashboard

## Project Description
This project is a simple React application built using Vite.
It demonstrates core React concepts such as:
- Components
- Props
- State
- Controlled inputs
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering
- Composition using children

## File Organization
- App.jsx: Root component, manages application state
- ProductList.jsx: Renders a list of products
- Product.jsx: Displays a single product
- Card.jsx: Reusable layout component
- main.jsx: Application entry point

## Challenges Faced
- Structuring components correctly
- Ensuring controlled input behavior
- Managing conditional rendering using state
